🔑 Authentication & Authorization

I have learned about authentication and authorization, which are essential for securing web applications. Authentication verifies user identity, while authorization controls user access.

🔧 Created APIs for:

To implement authentication, I built various APIs using Node.js and Express:

📝 Signup – Allows users to register securely.

🔐 Login – Authenticates users with credentials.

🚪 Logout – Ends user sessions safely.

📧 Email Verification Before Signup – Ensures users register with valid email addresses.

🔄 Password Reset with OTP Verification – Provides a secure way for users to reset passwords via OTP.

📦 Used npm Packages & Technologies:

To achieve this functionality, I used several npm packages:

✉ Nodemailer – For sending verification and password reset emails.

🔐 Crypto – For encrypting and hashing passwords securely.

🔑 JSON Web Token (JWT) – For authentication and maintaining user sessions.

⚡ Express – As a backend framework to create APIs.

📂 File System (fs) – For managing files on the server.

🖼 EJS Template – For rendering dynamic HTML pages.

🍪 Cookie Parser – To handle cookies for session management.

🛠 Dotenv – For managing environment variables securely.


🚀 My Learning Experience:

While working on authentication and authorization, I understood how to securely manage user data, implement token-based authentication, and send verification emails. This knowledge is crucial for building robust and secure web applications.

I’m excited to implement these concepts in real-world projects and improve my backend development skills further!
